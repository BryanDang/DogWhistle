EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
--------------------
The meeting focused on brainstorming an app that facilitates AI-assisted conversation recording with user consent, exploring potential features and monetization strategies.

DETAILED SUMMARY
--------------------
The team discussed the concept of an app designed to record conversations with user consent, using a high-pitched sound to trigger consent notifications. The app aims to integrate seamlessly with productivity and collaborative apps, allowing users to manage recording preferences. The discussion also touched on potential monetization strategies, such as enabling paid conversations for professionals or celebrities. The team agreed to research existing solutions and consider future hardware integration, while deferring additional feature development to avoid distractions.

KEY INSIGHTS
--------------------
• The app aims to reduce friction in obtaining user consent for recording conversations.
• Monetization could involve enabling paid interactions for professional or celebrity conversations.

TOPICS DISCUSSED: AI-assisted conversation recording, User consent mechanisms, Monetization strategies

FULL TRANSCRIPT
--------------------
Okay, so let's describe this idea, okay? How would you, how would you start? We're thinking about app that allows users to give consent to be recorded and processed by AI during the conversation. And this process should be like, we're trying to decrease the friction in this process to make it super simple with one button interface. And how it works under the hood, it always transmits a specific sound, high pitch sound generated like to the user, for each user. And the other person who use the same app, the app always like listening and if it's here, the sound, both users turn like this high pitch signature. Yeah. The notification pops up asking for your consent. If you press yes, conversation will be recorded, saved in the cloud. Let's say like AI bubble. And you both have the access to this thing. You can change preferences when this app should be turned on or this ask for consent turn on and off. For example, it can be worked only when you use some professional apps like Miro or Zoom. We can ask those companies to add this. It gets triggered when it's associated with like productivity apps like Calendar, Mailbox, Messenger, Workspace Messengers. Like any app that falls under the app store as productivity, it comes with this API. Or where you work with several people at the same time. Or when you're working with several people at the same time. I mean, where you have like a group, something group, because who cares if you like a... Like collaborative apps, right? Yeah. Yeah. Collaborative apps. Right. Right. And then so there is an option to click record. Then it requires the other person on the other side to like it auto triggers this event where and it's kind of an event listener where it listens for the signature and it maps your conversation to the signature in a cloud space somewhere. And it allows them to consent before the conversation starts recording. And then also afterward consent. And maybe insert some key words that they don't want, you know, certain... Tough words. Yeah. Like, like, you know, I, uh, I'm dodging texts. I don't believe it. Yeah. Okay, cool. All right. Is that enough? Like, did we capture it pretty well? Or like... I think that's for now it's enough because we can like make it like a more and more and more on top of it, but it's useless for tomorrow. I mean, it's just destruction for us. Okay, so you want to work on this for tomorrow, yes? I'm, I'm happy to work with this with you. I mean, if we can do that. I'm still thinking about like to have some hardware extra thing, but we can just focus on this part. You know what? I would do some research. Is there any other apps that have same thing? Yeah. That should be easy enough because I'm going to take the script and punch it into Chachabit. I'll ask you if something like this already exists. Oh, one, one, one idea just for the future. How we can monetize this thing. If we apply to this thing, the option for payment conversation, you know, for example, if you're a professional, like a therapist, you can say, okay, we, we're now in the conversation and we can do transaction during this conversation. Or maybe you want to talk to your, like a, you're a fan of either Taylor Swift and you want to talk to Taylor Swift. You can just pay money. Oh yeah. I mean, like incorporate like a payment option into, yeah. And also by consent, you know? Yeah. That could be interesting. Okay. Cool. All right.
