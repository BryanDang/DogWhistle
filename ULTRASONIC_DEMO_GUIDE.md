# üîä DogWhistle Ultrasonic Signature Demo

## What This Shows

A **working demonstration** of ultrasonic device pairing using actual high-frequency sounds (18-19 kHz) - the core innovation of DogWhistle!

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- **Uses 18-19 kHz** (edge of human hearing)
- Young people might hear a faint high-pitched tone
- Real implementation would use 20+ kHz (truly inaudible)
- Works best with quality speakers/microphones
- Chrome/Safari recommended

## üéØ Demo Flow

### Step 1: Show Your Device
1. Open http://localhost:8000
2. Each device gets unique:
   - **Device ID**: 6-character code
   - **Frequency**: Specific tone (18.X kHz)
3. Say: "Each device has a unique ultrasonic signature"

### Step 2: Transmit Signature
1. Click "Start Transmitting"
2. **Visual waves animate** (representing sound)
3. Frequency shown: "Transmitting at 18.5 kHz"
4. Say: "This is broadcasting an inaudible signature"

### Step 3: Listen for Others
1. On second device, click "Listen for Others"
2. **Frequency visualizer** shows incoming sounds
3. When devices detect each other:
   - Device ID appears
   - Shows detected frequency
   - Turns green when paired

### Step 4: Group Recording
1. Once paired, "Start Group Recording" appears
2. All paired devices join session automatically
3. No manual codes needed!

## üì± Multi-Device Demo Setup

### Best Setup:
1. **Laptop**: Transmitting (better speakers)
2. **Phone**: Listening (hold near laptop)
3. Show pairing happens automatically

### Alternative:
- Two browser tabs (different windows)
- One transmits, one listens
- Shows the concept clearly

## üé≠ Demo Script

### Opening (30 sec)
"DogWhistle uses ultrasonic signatures - like a digital dog whistle - to automatically connect devices for meeting recording."

### Pairing Demo (45 sec)
*Start transmitting on Device 1*
"This device is now broadcasting at 18.5 kHz"

*Start listening on Device 2*
"Watch as it detects nearby devices..."

*Devices pair*
"No QR codes, no typing - just automatic discovery"

### Explain Benefits (30 sec)
- "Works through cases and pockets"
- "No camera needed like QR codes"
- "Completely silent to humans"
- "Range limited for privacy"

## üí° Technical Talking Points

**If Asked About the Technology:**
- Uses Web Audio API for generation/detection
- Each device gets unique frequency (100+ possible)
- Modulation encodes device ID
- Similar to how Chromecast finds TVs

**Privacy & Security:**
- Limited range (same room only)
- Can't penetrate walls
- Requires explicit consent to record
- No internet needed for pairing

## üé® Visual Elements

1. **Animated Sound Waves** - Shows transmission
2. **Frequency Visualizer** - Real-time audio spectrum
3. **Device Cards** - Clean UI for paired devices
4. **Live Status Updates** - "Detected device: A3B2C1"

## üö® Troubleshooting

**"Can't detect other device"**
- Ensure volume is up
- Devices need to be within 3-6 feet
- Some phone speakers can't produce 18+ kHz well

**"I can hear something"**
- Normal for demo (using 18-19 kHz)
- Real product uses 20+ kHz (inaudible)
- Lower volume if needed

**"Multiple devices detected"**
- Feature, not bug! Shows group capability
- Can pair unlimited devices

## üèÜ Wow Factors

1. **Actual Ultrasonic Sound** - Not simulated
2. **Automatic Discovery** - No user input needed
3. **Visual Spectrum** - See the invisible
4. **Instant Pairing** - Sub-second detection
5. **Group Formation** - Multiple devices connect

## üìä The Story

"Traditional meeting apps require everyone to join a link or enter a code. DogWhistle uses ultrasonic signatures - like sonar - to automatically connect everyone in the room. It's as simple as sound."
