Every day, we leave insights on the table—ideas, decisions, even commitments—lost because we forgot to hit record. We built a way to fix that, without interrupting the flow of conversation.


We all know the pain of walking out of a meeting and thinking this.

AI summaries are powerful—but only work if the conversation gets recorded in the first place

“Damn—we should’ve recorded that!”

Recording is opt-in—it can kill conversation spontaneity. 

When you ask, it gets awkward–can change the tone, or put-off certain sharing entirely

When no one asks, then moments, ideas, and actionables are lost.

Problem

Impact
DogWhistle turns the awkward ask into a discreet handshake—consent, comfort, and clarity, minus the friction. 

It’s like capturing lightning in a bottle—after the storm has passed.

Live Demo

A DogWhistle device always emits and listens for an ambient ultrasonic ping. 

Other nearby DogWhistle-loaded devices pick it up silently, begin recording ambiently.
Under the hood


After the conversation, everyone gets a nudge: ‘Would you like to revoke consent to a shared meeting transcript?’ 

You always can ‘opt out’ to wipe meeting file from being uploaded and processed.

If both sides consent, everyone gets audio file-access (for transcripts, summary, etc)

DogWhistle Summary
